This is a simple CLI tool to setup a basic project structure skeleton for web application.

## Tech stack 

NodeJS

## Description

Sometimes, I feel that creating proper project structure for web applications built on NodeJS is just repetitive, so I thought why not automate it with some script.
The project structure as described in this project is the one suggested by [alextanhongpin](https://github.com/alextanhongpin). You can check in more detail, [here](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/node-js-folder-structure)
